# 2021-Machine-learning

This project was carried out during Summer 2021. Our team was trying to use Python Machine Learning to predict the patients's stroke possibility. The original health care data was recorded in 'healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv'. I was responsible for processing the raw data ( abnormals and missing data), as well as the final interactive graph.

The jupyter notebook file was revised recently. Some of the libraries we used have changed grammar. 
Until 18/09/2024, main issue is on 'IPython' module. The IPython module was not recognised even after re-installing in cmd. Some of the graphs can not be plotted.
